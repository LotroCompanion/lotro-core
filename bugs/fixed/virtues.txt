Virtues:
If a racial trait gives a virtue bonus, it applies only on active virtue, not on passive virtue...

1) Example on glumlug:
Fidelity is: 45
Virtuous Dwarf gives +1 Fidelity, Loyalty, Honesty

Fidelity is selected in the active virtues.
Its active stats match rank 45+1=46: 156 Vitality, 2032 Tactical Mitigation, 610 Physical Mitigation
Its passive stats match rank 45: 145 Morale.
LC uses 46 for both => 151.56 Morale

Loyalty not selected in the active virtues.
Its active stats match rank 53+1=54: 639 Vitality, 2049 Armour, 1564.272 Incoming Healing
Its passive stats match rank 53: 295 Morale.
Stats are OK if we select rank 53.

Same for honesty.

2) Same on Ethell with Virtuous Man
(Patience and Justice)
Using +1 rank to match active stats will lead to resp 1.75 and 1.98 additional morale.
Total: 3.93 (+ Steeled Resolve and Motivated morale buffs). This explain part of the +12 additional morale.
